This is a basic implementation of vector database. We used Qdrant.
1. At first we collected our datasets
2. Then the datasets were converted to embeddings by using SentenceTransformer framework (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
3. Made a vector database using Qdrant
4. These embeddings are added to the vector database
